# C
I decided to learn C since, as an intermediary language, there is a requirement to learn how to allocate/deallocate memory,
how to properly define variables, and how to use pointers; if you want to achieve a leve of compitence with the language. 

Do to the lower levels of functionality available with C, I use it when studying algorithms, 
discrete mathematics (in particular, geometry or graphs) or interacting with the kernel or sockets.
